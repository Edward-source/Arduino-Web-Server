## Hello World 👋 

I am planing to make a Windows 10 OS simulator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and render it from arduino uno 😀

<h1>
  Microsoft Windows 10

## Project Description

By equipping an Arduino with an Ethernet shield you can turn it into a simple web server, and by accessing that server with a browser running on any computer connected to the same network as the Arduino, you can perform a variety of tasks. Using an Ethernet shield, you can use an Arduino as a web server.

## Arduino Web Server Project Hardware
 
To use an Arduino as a Web server, you need the following:

Arduino Mega2560 (or Arduino UNO)
Ethernet shield
Wired LAN Connection with speed of 10/100Mb
Arduino Web Server Board Connections
The Ethernet shield connects the Arduino to the Internet. The setup is very simple: just plug the header pins of the shield into your Arduino, then connect an Ethernet cable to the shield.
