Hosting web pages on arduino within LAN

# Project Description

By equipping an Arduino with an Ethernet shield you can turn it into a simple web server, and by accessing that server with a browser running on any computer connected to the same network as the Arduino, you can perform a variety of tasks.Using an Ethernet shield, you can use an Arduino as a web server.

By equipping an Arduino with an Ethernet shield you can turn it into a simple web server, and by accessing that server with a browser running on any computer connected to the same network as the Arduino, you can:

Read the state of a switch (using simple HTML).

* Control hardware from the webpage (using Javascript buttons).
* Read value of a sensor (using simple HTML).

## Arduino Web Server Project Hardware
 
To use an Arduino as a Web server, you need the following:

Arduino Mega2560 (or Arduino UNO)
Ethernet shield
Wired LAN Connection with speed of 10/100Mb
Arduino Web Server Board Connections
The Ethernet shield connects the Arduino to the Internet. The setup is very simple: just plug the header pins of the shield into your Arduino, then connect an Ethernet cable to the shield.  The image below shows this setup:
